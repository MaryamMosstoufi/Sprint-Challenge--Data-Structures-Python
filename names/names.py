# ---------- Stretch Goal -----------
# Python has built-in tools that allow for a very efficient approach to this problem
# What's the best time you can accomplish?  There are no restrictions on techniques or data
# structures, but you may not import any additional libraries that you did not write yourself.

# duplicates = [i for i, j in zip(names_1, names_2) if i == j]
